# Exercise 4

You may use Vue files for all of them, but if you would like to try a global registration using the `component` function on the Vue class you are more than welcome to experiment with that.

1. Create a Page Header Component in Car Tool. The Page Header component should have template which uses a `<header>` and `<h1>` to display the page header for the application.

2. Create a Page Footer Component in Car Tool. Its template should look like this:

```html
<footer>
  <small>[copyright symbol] 2020, My Car Company, Inc.</small>
</footer>
```

Make the content as dynamic as you think it should be.

3. For the section headers of "Car Table" and "Car Form", create a component for each of them as well.

4. Utilize the four new components within `main.js` in the Vue Instance.

5. Ensure it works!
