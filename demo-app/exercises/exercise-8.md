# Exercise 8

1. Create a new component named Car Edit Row. The Car Edit Row component will display a table row where the make, model, year, color and price columns are input fields. The id column should not be an input field. The last column, the Actions column, will contain two buttons, one to Save and one to Cancel. Do not implement the Save and Cancel buttons.

2. Add a new button to the Actions column of the Car View Row component. The label on the button should say "Edit". When the button is clicked, change the Car View Row to a Car Edit Row. Only one row is editable at a time. You data structure should only allow for one row to be edited at a time.

3. Ensure it works!
